        <section name="Configuration">
            <p>
                Configuring Tweial is not that difficult.  This page documents 
                everything you need to do.
            </p>
        </section>
		
        <section name="JRE">
            <p>
                Tweial requires Java 8+. The Windows and Linux downloads come embedded
                with a Java 8 JRE, so Tweial does not depend on the
                system-level JRE to run.  
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you want to override the JRE which comes embedded
                with Tweial, you can do so by editing, in the <code>[TWEIAL_HOME]/bin/</code>
                directory, the <code>start-tweial.sh</code>, <code>start-tweial.bat</code> 
                files.

        <section name="Logging">
            <p>
                See the <a href="logging.html">Logging page</a> for more information
                about configuring logging.

        <section name="SMTP Account">
            <p>
                Tweial needs the SMTP information for your email provider. Each
                email provider is different so how you get this information is 
                up to you.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <code>[TWEIAL_HOME]/conf/</code> directory, make a copy
                of <code>email(example).properties</code> as <code>email.properties</code>.
                Edit <code>email.properties</code>, adding your SMTP account
                details.
            </p>

# This file holds the information needed to access your email account.

        <section name="Twitter Account">
            <p>
                Tweial uses the <a href="http://twitter4j.org/en/" alt="Twitter4J project">Twitter4J</a>
                libraries to communicate with Twitter.  In order for this 
                communication to be successful, you need to add Tweial as an 
                authorized application on your account.  
            </p>
            <p>

                Twitter account, in the <code>[TWEIAL_HOME]/conf/</code> directory, make a copy
                of <code>twitter(example).properties</code> as <code>twitter.properties</code>. 
                Edit <code>twitter.properties</code>, adding the OAUTH details.
